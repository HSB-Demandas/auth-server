# üß† Guiding Principles

## üß† Guiding Principles

- **Understand First, Code Later**: Do not implement any logic before reading and comprehending the entire documentation.
- **TDD is Mandatory**: Follow the strict Test-Driven Development cycle‚Äîtests must come before any code.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Prioritize simplicity. Avoid unnecessary abstractions or premature optimizations.
- **SOLID Principles**: Respect single responsibility, interface segregation, dependency inversion, etc.
- **Failing Tests First**: Ensure all planned tests fail before starting implementation.
- **Progressive Complexity**: Always implement the simplest test and logic first, then scale up.
- **Integration Tests Must Be Isolated**: Use environment flags to enable real-world integration testing only when explicitly requested.
- **Strict Sequential TDD**: Never implement or write multiple tests or classes in advance‚Äîwork one test at a time, only progressing once it passes.
- **Pydantic by Default**: All data structures, inputs, outputs, and configs should use Pydantic models. Avoid using raw dictionaries for transferring data across layers.
- **StructLog for Logging**: Always use StructLog as the default logging tool for all modules, components, and services.

## üèóÔ∏è Environment Setup

### 1. Virtual Environment Location
```bash
# Find the virtual environment location
which python
# Should point to something like: /path/to/project/.venv/bin/python
```

### 2. Project Root Path
```bash
# Get the project root path
python -c "import os; print(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))"
```

### 3. Verify Environment
```bash
# Check if in correct virtual environment
which python  # Should point to .venv/bin/python
which pip     # Should point to .venv/bin/pip

# Verify Python version
python --version
```

### 4. Package Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies in virtual environment
poetry install

# Verify installed packages
poetry show

# Check package versions
poetry show --tree
```

## üîÑ Implementation Workflow

### üö´ Phase 0 ‚Äî Do Not Implement Yet

> ‚ùóÔ∏è No classes, functions, or logic should be written at this stage.

- LLM must:
  - Read and understand all documentation
  - Analyze interfaces, config files, dependencies
  - Produce a summary (optionally) of system understanding

### 1. Initial Analysis
- **Read Documentation First**
  - Study the library documentation thoroughly
  - Identify all required components and their relationships
  - Note any special requirements or constraints

- **Define Scope**
  - Break down the implementation into clear, manageable steps
  - Identify dependencies between components
  - Create a prioritized implementation plan

### 2. TDD Implementation Cycle

### üß™ Phase 1 ‚Äî Design the Complete Test Plan

- Write unit tests for all desired behavior before any logic
- Order tests from simplest to most complex
- Include error, edge case, and integration stubs
- All tests should initially fail to confirm correctness

### üîÅ TDD Execution Steps (Strict Sequence)

This section outlines the exact sequence to be followed. **No deviations are allowed** from this step-by-step method:

#### ‚úÖ Step 1 ‚Äî Plan the Tests
- Identify the full set of unit and integration tests based on the documentation and requirements.
- Do **not** write any implementation code.
- Do **not** write the test code itself yet ‚Äî only plan the tests and document their purpose.

#### ‚úÖ Step 2 ‚Äî Define the Execution Sequence
- Organize the planned tests in a logical order:
  - From the least complex to the most complex
  - From most isolated (unit) to more integrated
- Prioritize foundational components and simple data validation first

#### ‚úÖ Step 3 ‚Äî Implement the First Test
- Write the code for the **first test only**
- This test must **fail** initially

#### ‚úÖ Step 4 ‚Äî Make the First Test Pass
- Write the minimal class, function, or structure required to make the current test pass
- Do not refactor or implement other classes or methods yet

#### ‚úÖ Step 5 ‚Äî Move to the Next Test
- Only after the current test passes, proceed to the next planned test in the sequence
- Repeat the cycle:
  - Write the test
  - Watch it fail
  - Implement just enough to pass it
  - Refactor only if necessary

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Restrictions
- Do not write multiple tests in advance
- Do not implement future classes preemptively
- Always work on a single test at a time
- Always make tests fail first before fixing them
- Maintain strict test ordering throughout

### 3. Component Implementation Order
1. **Types and Interfaces**
   - Define custom types
   - Create interfaces/protocols
   - Implement type validation

2. **Configuration**
   - Implement config validation
   - Add environment variable handling
   - Document required variables

3. **Client Implementation**
   - Create service client wrapper
   - Implement error handling
   - Add rate limiting

4. **Sender Implementation**
   - Implement core functionality
   - Add input validation
   - Handle service responses

5. **Verifier Implementation**
   - Add verification logic
   - Implement validation rules
   - Handle verification errors

## üìã Implementation Requirements

### 1. Code Structure

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è All configurations and structured data must be implemented using Pydantic models. Avoid using plain dictionaries to pass data between components or layers. Always prefer strongly typed, validated structures.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, validator
from typing import Optional

class Config(BaseModel):
    """Configuration for the service"""
    account_sid: str = Field(..., description="Twilio Account SID")
    auth_token: str = Field(..., description="Twilio Auth Token")
    from_number: str = Field(..., description="Sender phone number")
    
    @validator('from_number')
    def validate_phone(cls, v):
        if not v.startswith('+'):
            raise ValueError('Phone number must start with +')
        return v
```

- **Type Hints**
  ```python
  def send_message(
      phone: str, 
      message: str
  ) -> "MessageResult":
      """Send SMS message"""
  ```

### 2. Error Handling

- **Custom Exceptions**
  ```python
  class ServiceError(Exception):
      """Base exception for service errors"""
      
      def __init__(self, message: str, code: str = None):
          self.code = code
          super().__init__(message)

  class InvalidPhoneNumberError(ServiceError):
      """Raised when phone number is invalid"""
      
      def __init__(self, phone: str):
          super().__init__(f"Invalid phone number: {phone}", "INVALID_PHONE")
  ```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è All logging should use StructLog. This ensures consistent, structured logs throughout the application.

- **Logging**
  ```python
  import structlog
  
  logger = structlog.get_logger()
  
  def handle_error(error: Exception):
      logger.error(
          "Service error occurred",
          error_type=type(error).__name__,
          error_message=str(error),
          error_code=getattr(error, 'code', None),
          trace_id=get_trace_id()
      )
  ```

### 3. Documentation
- **Module-Level**
  ```python
  """
  Module implementing Twilio SMS functionality.
  
  This module provides a clean interface for sending SMS messages
  through Twilio's API, with proper error handling and validation.
  """
  ```

- **Function-Level**
  ```python
  def send_message(phone: str, message: str) -> "MessageResult":
      """
      Send SMS message to specified phone number.
      
      Args:
          phone: Recipient phone number (must start with +)
          message: Message content (max 1600 characters)
      
      Returns:
          MessageResult: Result of the message sending operation
      
      Raises:
          InvalidPhoneNumberError: If phone number is invalid
          ServiceError: If message sending fails
      """
  ```
