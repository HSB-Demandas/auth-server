## üß≠ Project Overview

The Auth Server is a multi-tenant Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform built with Django, designed to provide enterprise-grade authentication, authorization, and user management capabilities. The system is inspired by best practices from providers like Auth0 and AWS IAM while maintaining full extensibility and customization.

### Key Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each feature is encapsulated in a standalone Django app
2. **Reusability**: Core functionality is abstracted into reusable libraries
3. **Security First**: OWASP-compliant architecture with built-in compliance features
4. **Scalability**: Designed for multi-tenant operation with proper isolation
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new authentication methods, providers, and integrations

## üèó Architecture Overview

The backend is organized into two main categories:

1. **Core Applications**: Django apps that implement specific business domains
2. **Supporting Libraries**: Reusable components that provide common functionality

### Core Applications vs Supporting Libraries

- **Core Applications** (`apps.*`): Implement business logic and domain rules

  - Have their own models, views, serializers, and permissions
  - Contain business-specific logic and workflows
  - Are tightly coupled to the IAM domain
- **Supporting Libraries** (`libs.*`): Provide reusable technical components

  - Are decoupled from business logic
  - Can be used in other projects
  - Focus on technical implementation details
