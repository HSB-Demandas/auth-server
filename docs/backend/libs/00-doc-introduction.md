# ðŸ§± Library Design Guidelines

This section outlines the design principles and criteria for implementing backend libraries that support the system. These guidelines are based on the successful implementation of the Twilio SMS library and ensure consistency, testability, and maintainability across all libraries.

## âœ… Design Criteria

1. **Architecture Principles**
   - Follow SOLID principles
   - Favor composition over inheritance
   - Implement dependency injection for external services
   - Use type hints for better code clarity and maintainability

2. **Module Organization**
   - Each library should be organized into clear, focused modules:
     - `config`: Configuration handling and validation
     - `types`: Custom type definitions and data structures
     - `client`: External service client implementation
     - `exceptions`: Custom exception hierarchy
     - `sender`: Service-specific sender implementation
     - `verifier`: Service-specific verification implementation

3. **API Design**
   - Use clear, consistent method naming
   - Implement proper input validation
   - Return structured result objects
   - Handle errors gracefully with custom exceptions
   - Document all public interfaces with type hints

4. **Testing Requirements**
   - Unit tests must cover:
     - Input validation
     - Error handling
     - Success cases
     - Edge cases
   - Integration tests should:
     - Be optional and disabled by default
     - Use real service credentials
     - Be properly isolated
     - Document required environment variables
   - Mocks should be properly isolated and reusable

5. **Configuration Management**
   - All external service configurations must be injected
   - Implement proper validation of configuration values
   - Document all required configuration parameters
   - Provide clear error messages for invalid configurations
   - Support both synchronous and asynchronous configurations

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

1. **Directory Layout**
   - Follow standard Python package structure:

     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.py
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types.py
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ client.py
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sender.py
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ verifier.py
     â”‚   â””â”€â”€ exceptions.py
     â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_config.py
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_types.py

3. **Package Installation Process**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   poetry install
   
   # Add new dependency
   poetry add package-name
   
   # Add development dependency
   poetry add --dev package-name
   ```

4. **Package Documentation Requirements**
   - Document each third-party package in `docs/dependencies.md`
   - Include:
     - Package name and version
     - Purpose and usage
     - Configuration requirements
     - Known limitations
     - Security considerations
     - License information

5. **Package Validation**
   - Verify package compatibility with other dependencies
