## üß† Audit Strategy

- All logs must be immutable.
- Loggable actions include:
    - Creation, update, deletion of users, roles, apps, permissions
    - Security events such as MFA setup, provider linking
    - Admin API or dashboard operations
- Triggered via signals or explicit service layer calls
- Audit actions can be subscribed using a Pub/Sub signal-based system. Models or events can register themselves via decorators or a registry to automatically emit logs when watched fields change.
