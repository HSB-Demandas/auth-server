# Security Design

This document outlines the internal security mechanisms adopted by the Auth Server, focusing on password policies, communication protocols, cryptography, and system state management. The system adheres to principles from OWASP Top 10 and aligns with SOC 2/3 control expectations, focusing on secure design, data integrity, and operational robustness.

## üîë Password Security

### Password Storage
- Passwords are hashed using modern and secure algorithms (e.g., Argon2, PBKDF2, or bcrypt), with support for upgrading legacy hashes.
- Hashing includes configurable salt and iteration count to prevent rainbow table and brute-force attacks.

### Password Complexity Policies
- Enforced rules may include:
  - Minimum length (e.g., ‚â• 12 characters)
  - Upper/lowercase, numeric, and symbol inclusion
  - Reuse prevention: recent N passwords cannot be reused
  - Dictionary/blacklist checks for weak or common passwords

### Password Rotation
- Admin-defined expiration window (e.g., 90 days)
- Users are notified ahead of expiry and forced to change password
- Password reset flow includes verification checks and enforced MFA (if active)

---

## üîê Authentication State Security

### Forced Password Change
- Triggered by admin or system policy (e.g., breach detection)
- Login is interrupted until password is updated
- System flags enforce this behavior securely

### MFA Enforcement
- Enabled via configuration (`ENABLE_MFA`)
- Enforced after primary authentication
- MFA providers supported: Twilio (SMS), OTP-based apps (TOTP)

### Session Lockout
- Configurable rules for login failure limits
- Lockout duration and backoff increases progressively
- Reset only by trusted flow (e.g., email recovery or admin)

---

## üîí Transport and Application Security

### HTTPS and TLS
- All communication enforces HTTPS (TLS 1.2+)
- HSTS headers included to prevent downgrade attacks
- All cookies use `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite=Strict` flags

### CORS and CSRF Protection
- CORS policies restricted to known frontend origins
- CSRF tokens implemented in form-based and session flows
- Preflight requests validated for sensitive endpoints

### HTTP Header Hardening
- Standard security headers are configured:
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
  - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
  - `Content-Security-Policy` (customized)

---

## üîê Cryptographic Design

### Token Signing
- JWTs are signed using asymmetric keys (RS256)
- Private key stored securely and never exposed via any interface
- Public keys made available per application for token validation

### Sensitive Field Encryption
- Sensitive fields (e.g., phone, document ID) may be encrypted at rest
- Key management follows application environment lifecycle
- Field-level decryption restricted by application scope and policy

---

## üîè Application Secrets & Keys

### Key Rotation Strategy
- Application keys (signing) support rotation without downtime
- Key IDs (kid) included in JWT headers for key selection
- Previous keys kept active until all sessions using them expire

### Environment Secret Storage
- Secrets stored securely using environment variables or secret vaults
- No hardcoded credentials in codebase
- Access to secrets scoped and audited in deployment environment

## üß† Security Config Flags

| Flag                      | Purpose                                           |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `ENABLE_MFA`              | Enforces MFA for all or selected users           |
| `REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION` | Blocks login until email is confirmed          |
| `FORCE_PASSWORD_ROTATION` | Enforces password change on next login           |
| `ALLOW_AUTO_REGISTRATION` | Enables public or first-time social registration |

These flags modify authentication flows and directly impact the system‚Äôs state and risk exposure.

---

## üîê Scoped Permissions and Role Enforcement

- Permissions are never directly assigned to users ‚Äî all access is controlled through roles.
- Roles can include validation requirements such as:
  - Verified email address
  - Verified phone number
  - Active TOTP setup
- If a user does not meet one or more validation requirements, their role association is marked as **invalid**, and access is restricted until compliance is restored.

---

## üîë Provider Security and Linking

- Authentication providers (e.g., email/password, social providers) are explicitly enabled at the application level.
- During login or registration, if the chosen provider is not enabled for the app, the attempt is rejected.
- Providers linked to users are managed securely, and accounts may be merged or unlinked under administrator control.

---

## üîè Notification Delivery Integrity

- All notification templates (including email and SMS) include opt-out and unsubscribe links, enforced per communication channel.
- Email templates use well-formed HTML with fallback to plain-text versions to prevent spoofing or content hiding.
- Emails are monitored via supported providers that expose delivery, open, bounce, and spam events for security and auditability.

---

## üîí Token and Session Management Enhancements

- Sessions are explicitly trackable and revocable by the user and system.
- Login tokens are invalidated on password change, logout, or credential rotation.
- Each session is tied to an origin app and user context, reducing cross-application token reuse risks.

---

## üì¶ Webhook Integrity

- Webhooks are signed using HMAC (optional per webhook) to ensure authenticity.
- Only authorized apps may register and consume webhooks.
- Retry logic and delivery logs ensure full auditability of external communications.

---

## üìò Terms and Legal Compliance Controls

- Users are blocked from authentication if they have not accepted the latest versions of Privacy Policy and Terms of Use as configured per application.
- Terms acceptance is tracked per user, per version, and per document type.
- Terms content is immutable per version and cached for consistent verification.
